# NOTE  

Since mid-January 2023, all Freenom-based registries' domains (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, .gq) are down and not available: "application for new registrations is temporarily out-of-order," says the website, and according to our sources, several of the existing domains have ceased operation due to DNS resolution issues.
